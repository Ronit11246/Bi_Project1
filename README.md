# SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:

**Description**

This GitHub project provides a Call Cadence Analysis Dashboard, aimed at analyzing customer service call data. The dashboard utilizes Tableau to visualize and explore the monthly and weekly call cadence of a customer service team, providing insights into repeat calls and first contact patterns. The project includes interactive components and tables that allow stakeholders to explore different aspects of the call data.

**Features**

The Call Cadence Analysis Dashboard consists of several tabs and visualizations:



**Monthly and Weekly Call Cadence**

The first tab includes two bar charts showcasing the number of repeat calls received each month and the percentage of first contact calls by day of the week. The charts illustrate the frequency of repeat calls throughout the week and the distribution of initial contact calls across different days of the week.



**Repeat Calls by Date and Market/Type**

The second tab features two tables: "Repeat Calls by First Call Date" and "Calls by Market and Type." The "Repeat Calls by First Call Date" table provides insights into the number of different types of calls by date, allowing stakeholders to analyze call patterns over time. The "Calls by Market and Type" table further categorizes calls based on market and problem type, offering specific information on the markets that experience the most calls and the common problems prompting repeat calls.



**Market and Type for First Repeat Calls**

The "Market and Type for First Repeat Calls" visualization utilizes data from the previous table to visually represent the problem types that generate the most repeat calls for different markets. This visualization aids in identifying the specific issues that lead customers to make repeat calls within various markets.

**Calls Across Q1**

The final tab presents two charts: "Day 0 Calls by Market and Type Across Q1" and "First Repeat Call by Market and Type Across Q1."
These charts provide insights into the number of Day 0 calls and first repeat calls across different markets and problem types during the first quarter of the year. Users can identify which markets and problem types generate the most calls initially and which ones prompt customers to make repeat calls after their first contact.


**Usage**

This GitHub project serves as a comprehensive solution for analyzing call cadence in a customer service context. It provides an interactive dashboard in Tableau, enabling stakeholders to gain actionable insights into customer behavior and identify areas for improvement in call management and customer satisfaction.



**Next Steps**

The project can be further expanded by incorporating additional data sources or refining the existing visualizations to address specific business needs. Users can customize the dashboard to explore different time frames, markets, or problem types, providing a flexible tool for ongoing analysis and decision-making.

**Note**
This exemplar project serves as an example to guide your own analysis and visualization process. Feel free to explore the interactive components of the dashboard on Tableau Public to gain a better understanding of its functionality and adapt it according to your requirements.
